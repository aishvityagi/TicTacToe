# TicTacToe

The Tic Tac Toe game is a widely recognized and simple two-player game that provides an excellent opportunity to implement graphical user interfaces and core game logic in Java. This project aims to recreate the Tic Tac Toe experience using Java Swing, a graphical framework for Java that allows the creation of rich user interfaces. 
The primary objectives of the project are: 
To develop a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game with a responsive and userfriendly graphical interface. 
To implement two-player gameplay where players alternate turns. 
To ensure that the game checks for win conditions and handles scenarios like draw or victory. 
To allow the game to be restarted upon completion without closing the application. 
This report details the program structure, GUI design, game logic, and mechanics of the Tic Tac Toe game. 


The Tic Tac Toe game was developed using Java Swing to create a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board. Players take turns marking a button with either "X" or "O", and the program automatically checks for a win, draw, or continues to the next turn. The game is designed to be simple and interactive, with visual updates displayed immediately after each player's move. 
Key Features: 
Two-player Mode: Players X and O take turns alternately. 
Win and Draw Detection: The game checks for win conditions or a draw after each move. 
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game board, status display, and controls are implemented using Swing components. 
Game Restart Functionality: Players can restart the game at any time without closing the application.
